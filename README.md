# Thesis-NTUA-MS.c-Applied-Mathematical-Sciences-

This repository is the part of my thesis in my Master of Science in Applied Mathematical Sciences in National Technical University of Athens.
I have implemented the randomized svd algorithm and some alternative approaches such as "single pass","nystrom method","interpolative decomposition" and for the PCA 
method the randomized PCA and the robust pca algorithm for low rank and sparse decomposition of a large dimension matrix.
